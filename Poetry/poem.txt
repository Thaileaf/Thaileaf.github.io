You’re posing. You’re scared.
A body falls
and you learn to step over

a loosened head. You begin to appreciate
the heft of your boot soles,
how they propel you,

how they can kick in
a face–
the collapse

of a canopy bed
in an aerial bombardment,
mosquito netting doused

in napalm–cheekbones fragile
as moth wings beneath the heel.
You tighten your laces

until they hold together
a capable man.
Whatever rains,

the weight of your feet
swings you forward,
goose-stepping pendulums

a body less and less yours–
a body, God knows,
is not what makes you

anyway. So the hands
that said they never would
begin finding

grenade pins around their fingers,
begin flipping through this album
with soot under their nails






you were not ready
But they issued the shovel and the rifle and you dug
But to watch you sitting there between the sandbags
But to watch the sand spilling out the bullet holes
But what did they expect
But what did they really think a sheet of metal could prevent
But I sat rolling little ears of pasta off my thumb like helmets
But it was not a table of fallen men
But my hand registered fatigue
But the men in fatigues were tired of sleeping in shifts
But you snuck into town and dialed home until you wrote your fingers
       were tired
But the code for Shiraz was down
But all of Shiraz was down
But the sheet lightning above the Ferris wheel of rusted bolts
But I am sure they are alright you wrote Well to reassure yourself
But the wind like an old mouth shaking the unnamed evergreen outside
       my window
But what I mean is I'd like very much to talk a bit

Hello
