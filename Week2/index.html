<h2>As We May Think</h2>
<p>The text "As We May Think" was very interesting explain technology, science, and data
  collection in the lens of photography. It offers a unique perspective of what technology
  meant to people who the word technology was still something foreign, except to the
  experts at the time, and what it meant in the future. The authors description of wet and
  dry photography was unique because the term "dry photograph" was developed in the context
  of when photographs still needed to dry. The term is so foreign to us as the reader as
  our context of technology has been so radically changed. This leads us to the question
  of what current terms that we describe technology of the future that may seem
  anachronistic in the future. It is almost impossible to predict what, because we
  do not know what we don't know. Yet it is impressive how the experts, including the author,
  were able to accurately pinpoint some general sense of what modern technology looked like today.</p>
