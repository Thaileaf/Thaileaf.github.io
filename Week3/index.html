    <p>The first episode explores the meaning of art, and how the meaning can
      be changed by its surrounding. Art in its natural form is still, quiet, linked
      to the real world by time and space by being locked in
      a certain place, which all build up a to a feeling akin to mystification.
      This was how art was experienced pre camera age. Post camera age, marks a
      distinct change in how art is experienced, as art is now no longer locked
      in place. It is no longer travelled to, but can travel anywhere in the world
      as information. This destroys the original meaning, yet opens up arts meaning
      to more interpretations, which allows us to communicate with art more effectively.
      I think that technology has not destroyed the
      meaning of art like many think, but allows the freedom to experience that art
      free from the shackles of the original meaning, which may have been formed by any
      man or woman who we don't even agree with. However, this may allow avenues of
      corruption into the meaning of art by other third parties.</p>

    <h2>Episode 2</h2>
    <p> "To be naked is to be oneself. To be nude is to be seen
      naked by others and yet recognized for oneself. A nude has
      to be seen as an object." In the terms of art, nudity is seen abundantly in art.
      The main reason for this is that nudity is pleasing to the gaze, but in specific terms, the male gaze. The topic of
      nudity in art is linked to the view on women by men, that link inexorable to time. In the
      european oil painting era, women are depicted nude in art as "a calculated charm" for the man
      viewing from beyond the canvas. I feel that it is interesting though when technology is introduced,
      women who view the nudity relate more to it. In essence, it is not the nudity of the art that is
      the problem, as many of both genders enjoy nudity in art for different reasons. However, when
      that nudity extends into the aspects of control and monopoly of women into men, which is often depicted
      alongside nudity in european oil paintings, it corrupts the inherent good of some parts of nudity.
      It is possible to corrupt photographs as well, but it is harder because it is linked to reality
      by the laws of reality, which painted art isn't. In a sense then, technology has broken
      an aspect of control of women over men.

    <h2>Episode 3</h2>
    <p>"It is as though he lives in a house built of paintings. What
      is their advantage of over walls of stone and wood?" European art was obsessed in the
      aspect of wealth and power. Not only in the figures depicted, but it is also inherent
      to the act of owning these paintings themselves. They are an extension of wealth. You can
      connect this to the culture of the Europeans, specifically the superiority of their culture to
      others. European culture was believed to be stronger, richer, and more advanced than all others.

    <h2>Episode 4</h2>
    <p>Consumerism. That is the name of the game of art today.
      Art has a new meaning in modern day era. It inspires envy and envy inspires
      the need to achieve, primarily through the consumption of goods. In the past,
      art used to define the facts of ones life. It did not inspire envy, as you could
      not be envious of yourself. You were locked into your way of life by a social hierarchy,
      so you could only paint yourself reaffirming your life. Today, art reaffirms other people's lives,
      so in an age where the promise of a better life can be achieved by anyone, it inspires envy in
      others. This promotes consumerism of goods which promise to lead to that way of life.
